ShoppingCart react-redux-router demo

 Based on previous two demos, this demo is to show how to use react-router with react-redux

To make thinks easier, I used create-react-app to create this demo. In this way you can save time and avoid the errors when you config webpack by yourself. The main purpose of this demo is to show how Router works in react. If you got used to react router V3 please be careful. V4 is different with V3. 

How to use it?

User create-react-app to create a react app.

type command: 'npm install react-router' to install router

type command: 'npm install react-redux redux' to install redux and react-redux

download the directories and files to your local computer

type command: 'npm start' to start the app

Because this demo mainly focuses on router , layout and CSS are not optimized. You can modify them to make the UI better. Also I used array and json object to simulate the data for simplicity. You can use json file or database to import the data.

The following is snapshot of this demo.
